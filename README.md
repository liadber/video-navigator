# Video Navigator

Video Navigator is a web application designed to demonstrate the management of a video streaming system. It provides a visual representation of a video monitoring system, allowing users to navigate through a mosaic of video streams. The application offers a seamless experience by enabling specific context menus for each video within the mosaic.

## Context-Aware Video Management:

Each video tile within the mosaic is equipped with a context menu tailored to its specific content. This allows users to interact with individual video streams effectively, accessing relevant actions and controls based on the context of each video.
